  <h1><b>Browser Tracking</b></h1>

  <p>
    Many common methods of preventing browser tracking are ineffective.

  <p>
    Blocking a few tracker domains does not actually prevent tracking. You cannot make a list of every single
    tracker domain and block them all since there are far too many. Enumerating badness does not work. <br>
    <br>
    Even if you did magically create a blacklist of every single tracker domain ever, the website does not need to
    connect to a third-party domain to run tracking code. Blocking Google Analytics does not prevent the website
    from simply running their own first-party tracking code. <br>
    <br>
    The website can then share this information to the people that made the trackers you've blocked so everyone
    gets the exact same information they would have gotten in the first place. <br>
    <br>
    Blocking trackers can only remove some low hanging fruit and is not a proper approach to improving privacy.
    This is the reason the Tor Browser <a href="https://2019.www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/#philosophy">
    does not include any tracker blockers</a>.

  <h3 id="privacy-badger">Privacy Badger</h3>

  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    <a href="https://privacybadger.org/">Privacy Badger</a> is a tracker blocker. It suffers from all of the
    same issues as described above and has more issues of its own. <br>
    <br>
    Privacy Badger works by detecting new trackers as you browse and adding them to a blacklist. It may sound
    appealing at first, but what that does is give you a completely unique fingerprint based on your browsing
    history. <br>
    <br>
    Privacy Badger also attempts to prevent canvas fingerprinting but <a
      href="https://adtechmadness.wordpress.com/2020/03/27/detecting-privacy-badgers-canvas-fp-detection/">
    this is not hard to bypass and can actually further add to your fingerprint</a>.
  </p>

  <h2 id="configuring-the-browser">Configuring/"hardening" the browser</h2>
  
  <img src="../img/browser-hardening.png" width="220" height="220" alt="Browser Hardening">

  <p>
    You cannot configure your browser to prevent tracking either. Everyone will configure their browser differently
    so when you change a bunch of about:config settings such as <code>privacy.resistFingerprinting</code> and pile
    on browser extensions like Privacy Badger, you're making yourself stand out and are effectively <i>reducing</i>
    privacy. <br>
    <br>
    Additionally, just disabling JavaScript, while preventing large vectors for fingerprinting, does not prevent
    fingerprinting entirely. Fingerprinting can be done with only CSS and HTML. One example is <a
      href="https://matt.traudt.xyz/posts/how-css-alone-YF4ciVY6.html">using @media rules to figure out your
    browser resolution</a>. <br>
    <br>
    You also cannot substantially improve security by configuring the browser. Changing a few settings will not
    fix deep architectural security issues. You can at <i>most</i> reduce some attack surface by disabling things
    but most people don't do this to an extent where it actually matters.

  <h2 id="fingerprint-testing-websites">Fingerprint Testing Websites</h2>

  <p>
    Fingerprint testing websites such as <a href="https://panopticlick.eff.org/">Panopticlick</a> <a
      href="https://matt.traudt.xyz/p/SkxEFK1m.html#testing-your-fingerprint">cannot</a>
    <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/effs-panopticlick-and-torbutton">reliably</a> <a

    test</a> your fingerprint. <br>
    <br>
    These websites determine the uniqueness of your fingerprint based off of their own userbase which will miss out on the
    majority of real users, thereby providing inaccurate statistics and is not a viable way of determining how well you fair
    off against fingerprinting in the real world. <br>
    <br>
    These websites also don't test for much. Do these websites fingerprint you by <a
      href="https://nitter.net/davywtf/status/1124146339259002881">where your cursor is
    on the screen</a>? By your <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/31324">clock skew</a>?
    By the <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2019-August/013989.html">performance of
    your device</a>? etc.

  </p>

  <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

  <p>
    The only real approach to preventing browser tracking/fingerprinting is by using a browser that is designed
    to prevent this by default and the users do not change it. The most effective browser that does this is the
    <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor Browser</a>. <br>
    <br>
    Although, the Tor Browser's <a href="https://2019.www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/">fingerprinting
    protections</a> aren't perfect and its security <a href="firefox-chromium.html">is quite weak</a>.
