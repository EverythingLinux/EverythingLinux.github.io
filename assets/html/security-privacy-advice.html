  <img src="../img/hardware.png" height="160" width="160" alt="Hardware">

  <p>
    On desktop, use a recent Windows Secured-core PC, MacBook or Chromebook. These all have numerous security advantages
    such as good verified boot, a strict IOMMU, etc. <br>
    <br>
    Mobile phone hardware is covered in the mobile operating system section.
  </p>

  <h2 id="operating-system">Operating System</h2>

  <h3 id="desktop-os">Desktop</h3>
  
  <img src="../img/desktop.png" height="180" width="180" alt="Desktop">

  <p>
    The desktop security model is very broken. It was not designed with security in mind — security is only a poorly implemented
    afterthought but there are some operating systems that are less bad in this regard. Stay away from desktop if you can and
    stick to mobile devices. <br>
    <br>
    Use Windows 10 (preferably in <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/s-mode">S mode</a> and on a Secured-core PC),
    macOS, ChromeOS or <a href="https://www.qubes-os.org/">QubesOS</a>. Generally, these operating systems have made substantial
    progress on adopting modern exploit mitigations, verified boot, sandboxing, memory safe languages and so on. <br>
    <br>
    There are advantages and disadvantages between them. I can't give an accurate recommendation as to which of these will suit
    you. You'll need to develop your own threat model. For example, Windows 10 has great exploit mitigations like their
    coarse-grained forward-edge CFI implementation, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secbp/control-flow-guard">
    Control Flow Guard</a>, while macOS has <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208330">full verified boot</a> to
    eliminate malware persistence. <br>
    <br>
    Some of these operating systems do have some privacy invasive telemetry but it can usually be disabled in the settings and
    verified with a network analyzer tool like Wireshark if you wish to be certain. <br>
    <br>
    The security of QubesOS depends entirely on how you use it. The security within the virtual machines matter a lot — don't
    neglect it. Make sure that you use secure guest operating systems and split everything between as many virtual machines as
    possible. Virtualization can be a very strong security boundary but it is not magic. I'd recommend reading <a
    href="https://seclists.org/dailydave/2010/q3/29">Brad Spengler's criticisms of QubesOS</a> to understand some of its limitations. <br>
    <br>
    <a href="linux.html">Do not use Linux</a> (QubesOS <a
    href="https://www.qubes-os.org/faq/#is-qubes-just-another-linux-distribution">is not a Linux distribution</a>).
  </p>

  <h3 id="mobile-os">Mobile</h3>
  
  <img src="../img/android-phone.png" height="180" width="180" alt="Android Phone">
  <img src="../img/iphone.png" height="170" width="162" alt="iphone">

  <p>
    Mobile operating systems were designed with security as a foundational component. They were built with sandboxing, verified boot,
    modern exploit mitigations and more from the start. They are far more locked down than other platforms. <br>
    <br>
    Use either the stock operating system or preferably, <a href="https://grapheneos.org/">GrapheneOS</a> on a Pixel >=3. Do not
    root your device, do not keep your bootloader unlocked and stay away from alternative operating systems like LineageOS as
    they substantially worsen the security model. Read <a href="android.html">
    https://EverythigLinux.github.io/android.html</a> for elaboration. <br>
    <br>
    Alternatively, use an up-to-date iPhone which is comparable to GrapheneOS on a Pixel. Do not jailbreak. <br>
    <br>
    <a href="linux-phones.html">Stay away from Linux phones</a>.
  </p>

  <h2 id="browser">Browser</h2>
  
  <img src="../img/chromium.png" height="145" width="145" alt="Chromium">
  <img src="../img/edge.png" height="150" width="140" alt="Microsoft Edge">

  <p>
    For security, use Chromium. Avoid Firefox or browsers based on it as they are currently <a
    href="firefox-chromium.html">very lacking in security</a>. The new Microsoft
    Edge browser that is based on Chromium may be a better choice for Windows users as it can utilize <a
    href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-application-guard/md-app-guard-overview">
    Windows Defender Application Guard</a> (WDAG). <br>
    <br>
    <img src="../img/tor_icon.png" height="140" width="140" alt="Tor">
    <br>
    <br>
    For privacy, use the Tor Browser and consider using the security slider. Do not assume that "hardening" Firefox or
    other browsers will make it private, <a href="browser-tracking.html">it won't</a>.
    Be aware that this has massively reduced security from other options as mentioned above. <br>
    <br>
    <img src="../img/bromite.png" height="150" width="150" alt="Bromite">
    <img src="../img/brave.png" height="150" width="150" alt="Brave">
    <br>
    <br>
    For a mixture of security and privacy, use <a href="https://github.com/GrapheneOS/Vanadium">Vanadium</a>,
    <a href="https://www.bromite.org/">Bromite</a> or <a href="https://brave.com/">Brave</a> although, none of these are
    as good as the Tor Browser when it comes to privacy.
  </p>

  <h2 id="messenger">Messenger</h2>
  
  <img src="../img/signal.png" height="150" width="150" alt="Signal">

  <p>
    <a href="messengers.html">Use Signal</a>, preferably with a burner or VoIP
    number.
  </p>

  <h2 id="email">Email</h2>
  
  <img src="../img/protonmail.png" height="172" width="172" alt="Protonmail">
  <img src="../img/tutanota.png" height="150" width="150" alt="Tutanota">

  <p>
    If you can, stay away from email but if you must use it, use a reputable email provider with a strong focus on security
    such as <a href="https://protonmail.com/">ProtonMail</a> and <a href="https://www.tutanota.com/">Tutanota</a>. <br>
    <br>
    Consider staying away from web apps as they <a href="https://protonmail.com/blog/cryptographic-architecture-response/">can
    provide weaker security</a>. When a user visits a website in a browser, that website can target that specific user with
    malicious JavaScript whereas with an app, the code is static. Additionally, apps can offer better protection against MITM
    attacks by pinning TLS certificates. This is commonly used in apps like <a
    href="https://protonmail.com/blog/tls-ssl-certificate/#Extra-security-precautions-taken-by-ProtonMail">ProtonMail</a>, <a
    href="https://www.signal.org/blog/certifiably-fine/">Signal</a>, etc. <br>
    <br>
    Although, websites in a browser are much less privileged and using an app could add additional attack surface.

  <h2 id="passwords-2fa">Passwords/2FA</h2>
  
  <img src="../img/keepass.png" height="170" width="170" alt="Keepass">
  <img src="../img/bitwarden.png" height="150" width="150" alt="Bitwarden">

  <p>
    Store passwords in a good password manager — <a href="https://keepass.info/">KeePass</a> or <a href="https://bitwarden.com/">
    Bitwarden</a> is recommended. Generate 20+ character passwords containing a completely random assortment of upper and
    lowercase letters, numbers and symbols. Use a different password on each website and enable two-factor authentication
    (2FA) for every website. Do not use SMS for 2FA as it is vulnerable to simjacking and man-in-the-middle attacks.
    Use an authenticator app like <a href="https://getaegis.app/">Aegis</a>.

    <li class="lilist">
      Do not put any sensitive information online if you can help it. If you must, use strong encryption.
    </li>

    <li class="lilist">
      Always use full-disk encryption. Use <a href="https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Home.html">VeraCrypt</a> for this or
      <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/information-protection/bitlocker/bitlocker-overview">
      Bitlocker</a> if on Windows.
    </li>

    <li class="lilist">
      Do not plug your devices into unknown ports.
    </li>

    <li class="lilist">
      Always update.
    </li>

    <li class="lilist">
      Do not install a bunch of sketchy "security" software. Keep it minimal.
    </li>

    <li class="lilist">
      Never leave your devices unattended.
    </li>

    <li class="lilist">
      Always use HTTPS. Manually type in the <code>https://</code> part when visting a website to prevent <a
      href="https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/41988/how-does-sslstrip-work">sslstrip attacks</a>. Make sure
      that the padlock icon is displayed in the address bar. Install <a href="https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere">HTTPS
      Everywhere</a> in your browser if it is not included already.
    </li>

    <li class="lilist">
      Install <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoScript">NoScript</a> to block content such as JavaScript as much
      as you can. JavaScript inherently presents a massive attack surface as it is arbitrary code executed straight off
      of a website. NoScript also provides protection against attacks such as <a

    <li class="lilist">
      Disable WiFi and Bluetooth when not in use.
    </li>

    <li class="lilist">
      Use airplane mode and/or take out your SIM card as much as possible to prevent cell tower triangulation.
    </li>

    <li class="lilist">
      Cover or remove any webcams or microphones.
